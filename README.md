# vkplatejax


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This code is based on the matlab implementation of the Von Karman plate
model found [here](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/VKPlate).

To run the time integration of the Von Karman plate model using JAX, the
coupling coefficients and the eigenmodes of the plate are precomputed
using the matlab implementation.

Example matrices can be downloaded with the following command:

``` bash
wget https://github.com/Nemus-Project/VKPlate/releases/download/0.2.0/param.zip -P matlab
unzip matlab/param.zip -d matlab
```

## Installation for Development

It is strongly recommended to use the [`uv` package
manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install the environment and
dependencies.

``` bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

otherwise you can create a virtual environment and install the
dependencies manually:

``` bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## How to use

Once everything is installed, you can run the `vkplate_opt.ipynb`
notebook.
