We can simulate strings, membranes, and plates in different ways. However, for most cases the steps are similar:

1. Define the parameters of the simulation
2. Get the eigenpairs
3. Discretize
4. Simulate

We will go through these steps for a string, a membrane, and a plate, for the linear and non-linear cases.
