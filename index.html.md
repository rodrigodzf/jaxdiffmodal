# vkplatejax


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This code is based on the matlab implementation of the Von Karman plate
model found [here](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/VKPlate) and the
analytical/Galerkin solution for the simply supported plate found
[here](https://github.com/rodrigodzf/VKGong).

## Installation for Development

It is strongly recommended to use the [`uv` package
manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install the environment and
dependencies.

``` bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

otherwise you can create a virtual environment and install the
dependencies manually:

``` bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## How to use

Once everything is installed, you can run the `vkplate_opt.ipynb`
notebook.
