# Simulating strings, membranes and plates with non-linearities


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The non-linear models are also similar to simulate. We add a non-linear
to the equation:

where *f*<sub>nl</sub> is the non-linear term. Again we get damped
harmonic oscillators:

where *f̄*<sub>nl, *μ*</sub> is the non-linear term in modal space. This
term differs depending on the type of non-linearity and whether we are
simulating a string, membrane or plate.

## Tension modulated plate
